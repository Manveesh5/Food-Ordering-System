# Food-Ordering-System

Description:
The Fast Food Ordering System is a simple console-based program written in C++ that allows users to place orders for fast food from a limited menu with four choices. This program is designed to demonstrate the basic principles of menu selection, user input, and order processing. Users can choose from a predefined menu and specify the quantity of each item they want to order. The program then calculates the total cost and provides an order summary to the user.

Key Features of the food ordering system:

Four Menu Choices: The program offers four fast food items for selection, each with a corresponding price, and each choice has another 4 subchoices.
User Input: Users can interact with the program by entering their choices and quantities.
Order Processing: The system calculates the total cost based on the user's selections.
Order Summary: It provides a summary of the user's order, including the items ordered, quantities, and the total cost.
